# A report on two different plans for retrospection

## Start, stop, continue, more of, less of wheel

The purpose of this plan is to gather information about what practices or things
the team would like to adjust, stop entirely or take into practice based on the
previous sprint. The plan is conducted by drawing a circle that is divided into
five sections that are named start, top, continue, more of and less of. Comments
are gathered and added to the wheel. The "action" categories help give
actionable steps for future sprints. This plan is limited to 10 to 25 minutes
depending on the group and sprint size.

In larger groups or projects the planning can be done such that different areas
e.g. testing are discussed in separate subgroups. Each of the subgroups creates
the wheel that was described earlier and then all wheels are later reviewed by
the whole team. At the end the team has to decide the actions that they want to
take based on the comments and proposals presented in the wheels.

## Glad, sad, mad

The purpose of this plan is to gather information about how the team felt (glad, sad or mad) about different issues and observations that arose during the
previous sprint. The actions that the team takes arises from the discussion that
the team has about the issues and not directly from which group they belong to.
The length of this plan is limited to an hour.

All team members get to write their own observations to
separate cards that they then present to the rest of the team. After that the
cards are placed to the appropriate glad, mad or sad column. The cards are then
grouped so that related or duplicate cards are placed together. The team members then mark which issues they would like to discuss - this prioritises the points.
The chair of the meeting then leads the conversation starting from the highest
priority issues. The primary focus of discussion should be to seek for actions
that can be taken to, for example, rectify issues that the team has noticed.
